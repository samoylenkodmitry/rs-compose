## 1. System Overview

The text input system is a vertical slice covering data storage, rendering, and input processing. It follows the **Jetpack Compose** architecture but is adapted for Rust's ownership model and the `compose-ui` rendering pipeline.

### Core Component Interactive Flow

1.  **Input**: User presses a key -> `winit` -> `AppShell` -> `FocusManager` -> `TextFieldHandler`.
2.  **State**: Handler mutates `TextFieldState` (via `edit()` closure).
3.  **Reaction**: `TextFieldState` (backed by `MutableState`) triggers recomposition.
4.  **Layout**: `TextFieldModifierNode` measures text using cached `TextMeasurer`.
5.  **Draw**: `TextFieldModifierNode` draws text + selection + cursor (if focused).

## 2. Data Models (`compose-foundation`)

### `TextFieldState` (The Source of Truth)
*   **Location**: `crates/compose-foundation/src/text/state.rs`
*   **Role**: Internal state holder. Application logic holds this and passes it to the widget.
*   **Storage**: Internally wraps `Rc<RefCell<TextFieldStateInner>>` and `Rc<MutableState<TextFieldValue>>`.
*   **Quirk**: Changes *must* go through `.edit(|buffer| ...)` closure. This ensures change notification and undo state capture.

### `TextFieldBuffer` (The Editor)
*   **Location**: `crates/compose-foundation/src/text/buffer.rs`
*   **Role**: Temporary, mutable view of the text/selection used *only* inside an `edit` block.
*   **Quirk**: All indices are **UTF-8 byte offsets**, not character indices. It enforces valid Unicode boundaries for all operations.

### `TextRange` (The Cursor/Selection)
*   **Location**: `crates/compose-foundation/src/text/range.rs`
*   **Role**: Immutable struct `{ start: usize, end: usize }`.
*   **Quirks**:
    *   `start` can be greater than `end` (indicating reverse selection direction). Always use `.min()`/`.max()` for slicing.
    *   `safe_slice(&str)` method handles UTF-8 boundary clamping automatically, avoiding panics on invalid byte indices.

## 3. Input & Focus Subsystem (`compose-ui`)

### The O(1) Focus Dispatch Trick
*   **Problem**: finding the focused node in a deep UI tree is O(N).
*   **Solution**: We use **Thread-Local Storage** to store the currently focused handler.
*   **Implementation**: `crates/compose-ui/src/text_field_focus.rs`
    *   `thread_local! { static FOCUSED_HANDLER: ... }`
*   **Flow**:
    1.  `AppShell` receives KeyDown.
    2.  Calls `text_field_focus::dispatch_key_event(e)`.
    3.  Focus module calls `.handle_key(e)` on the stored `Rc<dyn FocusedTextFieldHandler>` directly.
    4.  **Zero tree traversal required.**

### Key Event Handling
*   **Location**: `handle_key_event_impl` in `text_field_input.rs`.
*   **Role**: Shared logic for processing `KeyEvent` -> `TextFieldState` mutations.
*   **Scope**: Handles standard editing (typing, backspace, delete, enter) and navigation (arrows, home/end, ctrl+arrows).
*   **Quirk**: Word boundary detection (`word_boundaries.rs`) uses extensive Unicode classification to properly jump words.

## 4. Rendering Pipeline (`compose-ui`)

### `TextFieldModifierNode`
*   **Location**: `crates/compose-ui/src/text_field_modifier_node.rs`
*   **Role**: The "Node" that lives in the UI tree. Handles Layout, Draw, and Pointer Input.
*   **Architecture**: It is a *Modifier Node*, not a basic Widget. This separates layout policy (where to place it) from the text logic itself.

### The Draw Closure Pattern
To avoid ownership issues during the draw phase, `create_draw_closure(self)` captures necessary state (Rc references) and returns a `Fn(Size) -> Vec<DrawPrimitive>`.
*   **Quirk**: Focus and Cursor Visibility are checked **at draw time**, inside the closure.
    *   This means gaining focus *does not need a layout pass*, only a repaint.
    *   Cursor blinking *does not need a layout pass*, only a repaint.

### Pointer Input Delegation
*   **Pattern**: Following Jetpack Compose's `TextFieldDecoratorModifier`, `on_pointer_event()` is a no-op.
*   **All logic** is in the `pointer_input_handler()` closure, enabling clean separation.
*   **Features**: Click focus, cursor positioning, double-click word selection, triple-click select-all, drag selection.

### Cursor Animation
*   **Location**: `crates/compose-ui/src/cursor_animation.rs`
*   **Mechanism**: Global thread-local state tracks "is cursor visible".
*   **Loop**: `AppShell` event loop uses `ControlFlow::WaitUntil` to wake up exactly when the cursor needs to toggle (every 500ms).
*   **Optimization**: If the text field is not focused, the timer stops completely.

## 5. Specific Implementation Quirks

### 1. Undo Coalescing
Users hate when `Ctrl+Z` undoes one character at a time.
*   **Algorithm**: Consecutive edits are grouped into a "Batch".
*   **Batch Breaks When**:
    1.  Time since last edit > `1000ms`.
    2.  User types whitespace or newline (word break).
    3.  Selection moves explicitly (click/arrow key).
    4.  Non-insert operation occurs (delete, paste).
*   **Implementation**: `TextFieldState::edit()` tracks `last_edit_time` and manages a `pending_undo_snapshot`. The snapshot is only "committed" to the stack when the batch breaks.

### 2. Platform Clipboard
*   **Desktop**: Uses `arboard` crate. Copied text is sent to OS clipboard synchronously.
*   **Web**: (Planned) `navigator.clipboard`.
*   **Middle-Click (Linux)**: Supported via `Primary` clipboard selection. Selection changes in `TextField` automatically update the Primary buffer.

### 3. Text Measurement (Current Limitation)
*   **Status**: Currently uses `MonospacedTextMeasurer`.
*   **Metrics**: Hardcoded 20px line height, 8px char width.
*   **Implication**: Text inputs look monospaced regardless of font settings until a real text engine (Skia/Cosmic-Text) is integrated.

### 4. Layout Invalidation
*   **Scoped**: When text changes, we call `request_layout_invalidation()` on the specific node ID.
*   **Optimization**: This prevents the entire UI tree from re-measuring. Only the text field and its parents re-measure.

### 5. Line Offset Caching
*   **Location**: `TextFieldStateInner.line_offsets_cache` in `state.rs`
*   **Role**: Lazy-computed `Vec<usize>` of byte offsets where each line starts.
*   **Invalidation**: Cache is cleared on any text change via `edit()`.
*   **Benefit**: Enables O(1) line lookups for multiline rendering instead of per-frame string splitting.
