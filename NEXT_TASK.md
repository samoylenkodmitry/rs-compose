# RS-Compose Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: April 2026
**Modifier System Status**: ⚠️ Parity verification in progress (origin/main claims parity; see "Modifier System Reality Check")
**Documentation Status**: ✅ Comprehensive internals documented

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones (per origin/main)

### Modifier System (Nov 2025)
- ✅ `ModifierNodeEntry` stores `Rc<RefCell<Box<dyn ModifierNode>>>`
- ✅ `LayoutModifierNode::measure` returns `LayoutModifierMeasureResult` with placement control
- ✅ `LayoutModifierCoordinator` holds live node references (no proxy bypass)
- ✅ Chain preservation intended — currently **under re-validation** because `ResolvedModifiers` still flattens padding/size/offset
- ✅ Node lifecycle: `on_attach()`, `on_detach()`, `on_reset()`
- ✅ Capability-based dispatch with bitflags
- ✅ Core modifiers implemented: Padding, Size, Offset, Background, Clickable, etc.

### Documentation (Nov 2025)
- ✅ **MODIFIERS.md** (37KB) - Complete modifier system internals
- ✅ **SNAPSHOTS_AND_SLOTS.md** (54KB) - Snapshot and slot table internals
- ✅ **modifier_match_with_jc.md** - Parity status tracking
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for CI

### Test Coverage
- ✅ 460+ workspace tests passing
- ✅ Modifier chain composition and reuse
- ✅ Layout measurement and placement protocols
- ✅ Capability-based dispatch validation
- ✅ Integration with draw, pointer input, semantics

### Upstream main roadmap (Nov 2025 snapshot)
These items reflect the priorities already present on the upstream main branch so they do not get lost while reconciling the modifier findings on this work branch.

- **Performance Optimization**: benchmark modifier traversal, cache aggregated capabilities, pool allocations in `update_from_slice`, and establish a reusable benchmark suite.
- **API Ergonomics**: builder patterns for modifiers, common helpers, clearer RefCell error messages, and richer documentation/examples.
- **Advanced Features**: animated and conditional modifiers, modifier scopes, and custom coordinator hooks.
- **Testing & Validation**: property-based tests, integration scenarios, stress tests for deep chains, and performance regression tracking.

## ⚠️ Modifier System Reality Check (work branch)

- `ResolvedModifiers` still flattens padding/size/offset, losing modifier ordering (e.g., `padding.background.padding`).
- `ModifierNodeSlices` coalesces text and graphics layers to the last writer instead of composing them.
- `MeasurementProxy` remains in the public API even though coordinators measure nodes directly.

These gaps must be closed to reconcile the parity claim from origin/main with observed runtime behavior.

---

## 🎯 Current Priorities (merged)

### A) Modifier System Corrections (prevents merge conflicts with origin/main)
- Remove layout flattening: route padding/size/offset/intrinsics through live nodes and coordinators.
- Make draw/text slices composable: allow stacking graphics layers and multiple text entries in chain order.
- Decide the measurement proxy story: remove unused surface or integrate it meaningfully (e.g., borrow-safe async measurement).
- Add regression tests for mixed chains and slice composition to lock in ordering semantics.

### B) Real-World Application Development
**Goal**: Build production-quality example apps to validate the framework

- [ ] **Complex Desktop Application** - Multi-window IDE/editor-style app
  - State management across windows
  - Complex nested layouts with performance testing
  - Drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts
  - Custom rendering for code editor

- [ ] **Dashboard/Data Visualization App**
  - Charts, graphs, real-time data updates
  - LazyColumn/LazyRow with large datasets
  - Scrolling performance optimization

- [ ] **Form-Heavy Application**
  - Text input validation
  - Focus management
  - Tab navigation
  - Error states and accessibility

**Why**: Real applications expose edge cases and inform API improvements

### C) Performance Optimization & Benchmarking
**Goal**: Establish performance baselines and optimize hot paths

- [ ] **Benchmark Suite** (Priority: High)
  - Modifier chain traversal (various depths)
  - Recomposition with different invalidation patterns
  - Layout measurement with complex trees
  - Draw command generation
  - Memory allocation profiling

- [ ] **Optimization Targets**
  - Cache aggregated node capabilities (avoid recomputation)
  - Pool allocations in `update_from_slice`
  - Optimize `SnapshotIdSet` operations for common patterns
  - Reduce `RefCell` borrow overhead where safe

- [ ] **Profiling Infrastructure**
  - Flamegraph integration for layout/draw passes
  - Frame time tracking
  - Memory usage tracking

**Why**: Performance is critical for user experience; baselines prevent regressions

### D) Missing Core Features
**Goal**: Fill gaps in functionality to match Jetpack Compose completeness

- [ ] **Intrinsic Measurements** (High Priority)
  - Implement `IntrinsicMeasureScope` for Row/Column
  - `IntrinsicSize.Min`, `IntrinsicSize.Max` modifiers
  - Baseline alignment support

- [ ] **Text Editing** (High Priority)
  - TextField/OutlinedTextField composables
  - Cursor positioning and selection
  - IME integration (desktop, mobile)
  - Text selection gestures

- [ ] **Lazy Layouts Performance**
  - Viewport recycling optimization
  - Item key stability and reuse
  - Prefetching and smooth scrolling

- [ ] **Animation System**
  - `animate*AsState` helpers
  - `Animatable` and `Transition` APIs
  - Animated modifiers (size, offset, color, etc.)
  - Spring physics

**Why**: These features are essential for building real applications

### E) Developer Experience Improvements
**Goal**: Make the framework easier to learn and use

- [ ] **Enhanced Error Messages**
  - Better `RefCell` borrow panic context (which node, which operation)
  - Layout measurement constraint violations with debugging hints
  - Composition cycle detection with stack traces

- [ ] **Developer Tools**
  - Layout inspector (visualize layout tree)
  - Recomposition counter/highlighter
  - Performance overlay (frame times, skip counts)

- [ ] **Examples & Guides**
  - Getting started tutorial (counter → todo list → custom modifier)
  - Migration guide from immediate-mode UIs
  - Performance best practices guide
  - Custom layout guide

**Why**: Good DX accelerates adoption and reduces frustration

### F) Platform Support Expansion
**Goal**: Enable cross-platform development

- [ ] **Android Support** (Medium Priority)
  - `ndk_glue` integration
  - Skia renderer on Android surface
  - Touch input handling
  - IME support

- [ ] **Web Support** (Lower Priority)
  - WebAssembly compilation
  - Canvas/WebGL backend
  - Web event integration

- [ ] **iOS Support** (Future)
  - UIKit integration
  - Metal rendering
  - Touch and gesture handling

**Why**: Cross-platform is a key Rust value proposition

## 💡 Immediate Next Actions

**Modifier corrections (now)**
1. Replace layout flattening with coordinator-driven measurement and placement for padding/size/offset.
2. Allow stacking of draw/text slices; document ordering and add regression tests.
3. Either integrate or remove `MeasurementProxy`, updating docs and examples accordingly.

**Performance benchmarking (after parity validation)**
1. Set up Criterion benchmarks for modifier chain operations.
2. Profile the desktop-demo app to identify bottlenecks.
3. Establish baseline metrics before optimization.
4. Document findings in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.

**Application validation (parallel where possible)**
1. Choose a target app (e.g., markdown editor, kanban board).
2. Implement core features using existing APIs.
3. Document pain points and missing features.
4. Feed findings back into priorities above.
