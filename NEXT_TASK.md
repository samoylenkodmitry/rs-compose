# RS-Compose Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: April 2026  
**Modifier System Status**: `main` reports parity; the work branch is validating and fixing remaining gaps.  
**Documentation Status**: ✅ Comprehensive internals documented

---

## 🗺️ Main-Branch Milestone Snapshot (Nov 2025)
These items mirror what shipped on `main` so they stay visible after rebasing.

### ✅ Phase 1: Shared Ownership & Protocol (DONE)
- `ModifierNodeEntry` stores `Rc<RefCell<Box<dyn ModifierNode>>>`
- `LayoutModifierNode::measure` returns `LayoutModifierMeasureResult` with placement
- `LayoutModifierCoordinator` holds `Rc<RefCell<dyn ModifierNode>>`
- Direct `node.measure()` calls without proxy bypass
- Chain traversal handles RefCell borrows correctly

### ✅ Phase 2: Eliminating Flattening (DONE, per main)
- Flattening marked as removed; live node references drive layout
- Node lifecycle hooks implemented: `on_attach()`, `on_detach()`, `on_reset()`
- Capability-based dispatch via bitflags
- Core modifiers implemented: Padding, Size, Offset, Background, Clickable, etc.

### 📌 Other Main-Branch Priorities
- **Performance**: benchmark modifier traversal, cache aggregated capabilities, pool allocations in `update_from_slice`, reusable benchmark suite
- **API Ergonomics**: builder patterns, clearer RefCell errors, richer examples
- **Advanced Features**: animated/conditional modifiers, modifier scopes, custom coordinator hooks
- **Testing & Validation**: property-based tests, integration scenarios, deep-chain stress tests, performance regression tracking

---

## ⚠️ Reality Checks on the Work Branch
Observed divergences that must be addressed before the parity claim is trustworthy after rebasing.

- `ResolvedModifiers` still flattens padding/size/offset, losing modifier ordering (e.g., `padding.background.padding`).
- `ModifierNodeSlices` coalesces text and graphics layers to the last writer instead of composing them.
- `LayoutModifierCoordinator::measure` treats the absence of a measurement proxy as "skip the node" rather than measuring the live node.
- `MeasurementProxy` remains in the public API even though coordinators measure nodes directly.
- Placement is pass-through: `LayoutModifierNode::measure` returns only `Size`, blocking placement-aware modifiers (offset/alignment).

## 🤝 Merge-Friendly Reconciliation Plan
These steps combine `main`'s parity claims with the work-branch findings so rebasing keeps both perspectives.

1. **Fix layout modifier protocol**  
   Measure live nodes (or meaningful proxies) and return placement-aware results; remove the "no proxy = skip" behavior.
2. **Eliminate layout flattening**  
   Route padding/size/offset/intrinsics through live nodes and coordinators; add regression tests for mixed chains.
3. **Make draw/text slices composable**  
   Stack graphics layers and allow multiple text entries in chain order; keep pointer handlers ordered.
4. **Resolve the measurement proxy story**  
   Remove the unused surface or integrate it meaningfully (e.g., borrow-safe async measurement) and update docs/tests.
5. **Resume upstream priorities once parity is validated**  
   Continue performance, ergonomics, advanced features, and testing work from the main snapshot.

## 🎯 Active Focus Areas (post-rebase)

### A) Modifier System Corrections
- Remove layout flattening and keep ordering semantics.
- Compose draw/text slices instead of last-write-wins.
- Decide and implement the measurement proxy direction.
- Add regression tests for mixed chains and slice composition.

### B) Real-World Application Development
- **Complex Desktop Application**: multi-window, nested layouts, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, custom rendering.
- **Dashboard/Data Visualization App**: charts/graphs, large-data LazyColumn/LazyRow, scrolling performance.
- **Form-Heavy Application**: text validation, focus management, tab navigation, error/accessibility states.

### C) Performance Optimization & Benchmarking
- **Benchmark Suite**: traversal depth, recomposition patterns, complex layout measurement, draw command generation, allocation profiling.
- **Optimization Targets**: cache aggregated node capabilities, pool allocations in `update_from_slice`, optimize `SnapshotIdSet`, reduce `RefCell` overhead where safe.
- **Profiling Infrastructure**: flamegraphs for layout/draw, frame time tracking, memory usage tracking.

### D) Missing Core Features
- **Intrinsic Measurements**: implement `IntrinsicMeasureScope` for Row/Column, `IntrinsicSize.Min/Max`, baseline alignment.
- **Text Editing**: TextField variants, cursor/selection, IME integration, selection gestures.
- **Lazy Layouts Performance**: large dataset handling, viewport-aware recycling, smooth scrolling.
- **Draw/Graphics Enhancements**: layered draw modifiers, blend modes, shaders; composition of text and graphics slices.
- **Pointer/Input**: richer gesture recognizers, multi-pointer coordination, scroll/drag/zoom handling.
- **Accessibility & Semantics**: semantics tree parity with Jetpack Compose, focus traversal, screen reader annotations.
