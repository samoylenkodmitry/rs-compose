# Agent Notes for compose-rs-proposal

- no unsafe
- cargo test > 1.tmp 2>& # then read and fix all
- cargo clippy > 2.tmp 2>& # then read and fix all
- cargo fmt
- KISS, DRY, SOLID. don't copy-paste lazily
- Use `cargo add <crate>` to add dependencies.
- Use `cargo upgrade` to upgrade dependencies.
- Use `anyhow` for error handling in application code; use `thiserror` for library code.
- Write unit tests for all public functions and methods.
- Write integration tests in the `tests` directory.
- Follow idiomatic Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for types and traits).
- CamelCase for #[composable] functions
- Use `Result<T, E>` for functions that can fail; prefer specific error types over `Box<dyn Error>`.
- Use `Option<T>` for values that can be absent.
- Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous code; prefer `tokio` as the async runtime.
- do proper review mitigation; don't short-cut and do a honest professional work; be very strict to your code & architecture decisions; keep repo clean and don't put unfinished parts here; fix everything
- do not create a half-migrated state of the repo; don't "deprecate"; always change the existing code
- cargo clippy
- cargo test
- cargo tree --duplicates/cargo tree -i <package name> and make sure no duplicates (but do not apply vendor patches, and do not change libraries without asking, can suggest though)
- make sure android compiles [:app:assembleRelease] in project /home/s/develop/projects/compose-rs-proposal/apps/android-demo/android
- make sure wasm compiles apps/desktop-demo/build-web.sh
- (+robot tests)
- instead of accepting the shortcut always choose to fix the underlying architecture issue
- do not avoid and do not defer the big architecture refactoring when necessary
- if there is a bug start with writing a failing test that will catch it so we never regress to it again in the future
- do a code review; look for any shortcuts, lazyness, taking the easy path instead of doing the hard necessary work, poor architectural choices, everything that will shoot in the foot, poorly written code like it was a deadline 1 minute before end of the work day; but not invent the problems if there arent any- don't fear the significant arch change; everything is still pre-alpha; this is the right time for a big change
- do not ever git reset, always stash if needed
- do not ever rm -rf, prefer mv to some _old name
- all tests should pass, its never *not yours*
- zero warnings on all build/clippy/test commands, never *was pre-existing*
