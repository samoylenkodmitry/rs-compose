/// - Scroll gestures begin (visual scrolling starts)

/// you could be visually scrolling but still trigger a click on release.

/// Value of 8.0 was chosen as a reasonable touch slop that:
/// - Is large enough to ignore minor finger jitter on touch screens
/// - Is small enough to feel responsive for intentional drags
/// - Matches common platform conventions (Android uses ~8dp for ViewConfiguration.TOUCH_SLOP)
