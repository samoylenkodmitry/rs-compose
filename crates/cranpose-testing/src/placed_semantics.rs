//! What a screen reader is told, and where each of those things actually is.
//!
//! [`build_semantics_tree_from_applier`] answers the first half and carries no
//! geometry at all; a [`LayoutBox`] carries the geometry and knows nothing about
//! semantics. Every question of the form "is this control big enough / on the
//! display / where the label says it is" needs both halves joined, and the join
//! existed in exactly one place: inside the desktop robot, behind an `AppShell`,
//! a window and an event loop. A unit test that wants to audit a widget tree's
//! touch targets could not reach it.
//!
//! This is that join, headless. One composition, one measure pass, and a tree of
//! [`PlacedSemanticsNode`] carrying **two** boxes per node, because they are two
//! different questions and a Wear scaling list is precisely where they diverge:
//!
//! - [`PlacedSemanticsNode::layout_bounds`] is the box the measure pass gave the
//!   node — what the widget asked for and what an unscaled row occupies. This is
//!   the box the desktop robot reports, and the one to assert a widget's own
//!   declared minimum against.
//! - [`PlacedSemanticsNode::touch_bounds`] is the axis-aligned box the renderer
//!   draws and the hit test inverts, ancestor graphics layers included. A row
//!   that a scaling ramp shrinks to 0.73 is only tappable where it is drawn
//!   (`cranpose-render-common`'s `a_shrunken_row_is_only_tappable_where_it_is_drawn`
//!   settles that), so this is the box a finger has to find. It is `None` for a
//!   node the hit graph carries no region for — a label, a header, anything that
//!   is described but not interactive. Gesture containers such as scrollable
//!   lists are interactive even though they do not expose a click action.
//!
//! ## Every walk here reads the RETAINED tree, deliberately
//!
//! `compute_layout` returns a `LayoutTree` built from the `Placement`s a
//! `MeasurePolicy` returned. The scene the
//! renderer is handed is not: [`build_graph_from_applier`] walks the retained
//! node state and drops any node whose `is_placed` is false, and `is_placed` is
//! set by `placeable.place(x, y)` — *not* by pushing a `Placement` into a vec.
//! The two disagreed once and a whole widget set laid out correctly in every
//! assertion while reaching the device as an empty screen.
//!
//! So the layout boxes here come from [`build_layout_tree_from_applier`] and not
//! from the tree `compute_layout` hands back. All three walks — layout,
//! semantics, scene — then apply the same `is_placed` filter, and a node that
//! one of them loses is lost by all of them. A caller cannot be handed bounds
//! for a control the renderer never drew.
