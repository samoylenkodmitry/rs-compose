# Gradle Wrapper JAR

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file will be automatically downloaded by Android Studio when you open this project, or you can generate it by running:

```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
```

This is normal for Gradle projects and is not included in the repository to keep it clean.
